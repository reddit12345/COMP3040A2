# About
To describe the practical steps of how you host and format your resume and to relate the practical steps to the general principles of current Technical Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing.

# Prerequisites
- A resume in markdown format
- A markdown editor
- (Optional) Github pages or any other static site generator

# Instructions
## Use a lightweight Markdown
- Using a lightweight Markdown editor to write your resume and your README file is essential as it will broaden the compatibility of that file all across any devices and/or sites.
- One example of a Markdown editor is StackEdit. StackEdit lets you write Markdown files conveniently and efficiently.
## Use a Distributed Version Control System
- Making use of a version control system is very crucial in software development. It is a very powerful tool as it offers scalability, auditing, collaboration and recovery for software development.
