4. Set it as public, then click "**Create Repository**"

1. To upload existing files, click on "**Add File**" -> "**Upload Files**".
2. Find the necessary files needed to be placed in the repository.
3. Once all files are ready to be committed, click on "**Commit Changes**".

## 3. Build a Static Website
- Static site generators offers a good way to build documentation websites easily.
