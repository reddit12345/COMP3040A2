# Applying Etter's Modern Technical Writing principles to host an online resume and README
# About
To describe the practical steps of how you host and format your resume and to relate the practical steps to the general principles of current Technical Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing.

# Prerequisites
- A resume in markdown format
- A markdown editor
- (Optional) Github pages or any other static site generator
- README file (in Markdown format)

# Instructions
## Use a lightweight Markdown
- Using a lightweight Markdown editor to write your resume and your README file is essential as it will broaden the compatibility of that file all across any devices and/or sites.
- One example of a Markdown editor is StackEdit. StackEdit lets you write Markdown files conveniently and efficiently.
- Follow the guidelines on how to write an effective resume and README file discussed and shown in class.
## Use a Distributed Version Control System
-   Making use of a distributed version control system (DVCS) is paramount in software development. This tool is incredibly powerful - offering scalability, auditing, collaboration, and recovery features essential for successful software development endeavors.
- Github is one of the many DVCS out there and offers robust features to help you start, organize, and maintain your work development.
### Creating a repository
1. On Github home page, click on **home -> Repositories.**
2. On the repositories section, click "**New**".
3. Give the repository a name. Optionally, you may add a description.
4. Set it as public, then click "**Create Repository**"
### Uploading files
1. To upload existing files, click on "**Add File**" -> "**Upload Files**".
2. Find the necessary files needed to be placed in the repository.
3. Once all files are ready to be committed, click on "**Commit Changes**".

## Build a Static Website
- Static site generators offers a good way to build documentation websites easily.
- Site generators processes markup languages (like Markdown) to provide a unique variety of themes to let the documentation stand out.
- Jekyll is one of many site generators currently being used by thousands.
 
 ### Hosting the resume in a static website
1. Rename your resume to "**index.md**", this lets Github run the resume as the main page of the static site using Jekyll.
2. You may use templates by forking pre-existing samples by other users to your repository.
